MELIBOEUS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TITYRUS<BR>
</H3>

<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
MELIBOEUS<BR>
You, Tityrus, 'neath a broad beech-canopy<BR>
Reclining, on the slender oat rehearse<BR>
Your silvan ditties: I from my sweet fields,<BR>
And home's familiar bounds, even now depart.<BR>
Exiled from home am I; while, Tityrus, you<BR>
Sit careless in the shade, and, at your call,<BR>
"Fair Amaryllis" bid the woods resound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
TITYRUS<BR>
O Meliboeus, 'twas a god vouchsafed<BR>
This ease to us, for him a god will I<BR>
Deem ever, and from my folds a tender lamb<BR>
Oft with its life-blood shall his altar stain.<BR>
His gift it is that, as your eyes may see,<BR>
My kine may roam at large, and I myself<BR>
Play on my shepherd's pipe what songs I will.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
MELIBOEUS<BR>
I grudge you not the boon, but marvel more,<BR>
Such wide confusion fills the country-side.<BR>
See, sick at heart I drive my she-goats on,<BR>
And this one, O my Tityrus, scarce can lead:<BR>
For 'mid the hazel-thicket here but now<BR>
She dropped her new-yeaned twins on the bare flint,<BR>
Hope of the flock- an ill, I mind me well,<BR>
Which many a time, but for my blinded sense,<BR>
The thunder-stricken oak foretold, oft too<BR>
From hollow trunk the raven's ominous cry.<BR>
But who this god of yours? Come, Tityrus, tell.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
TITYRUS<BR>
The city, Meliboeus, they call Rome,<BR>
I, simpleton, deemed like this town of ours,<BR>
Whereto we shepherds oft are wont to drive<BR>
The younglings of the flock: so too I knew<BR>
Whelps to resemble dogs, and kids their dams,<BR>
Comparing small with great; but this as far<BR>
Above all other cities rears her head<BR>
As cypress above pliant osier towers.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
MELIBOEUS<BR>
And what so potent cause took you to Rome?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
TITYRUS<BR>
Freedom, which, though belated, cast at length<BR>
Her eyes upon the sluggard, when my beard<BR>
'Gan whiter fall beneath the barber's blade-<BR>
Cast eyes, I say, and, though long tarrying, came,<BR>
Now when, from Galatea's yoke released,<BR>
I serve but Amaryllis: for I will own,<BR>
While Galatea reigned over me, I had<BR>
No hope of freedom, and no thought to save.<BR>
Though many a victim from my folds went forth,<BR>
Or rich cheese pressed for the unthankful town,<BR>
Never with laden hands returned I home.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
MELIBOEUS<BR>
I used to wonder, Amaryllis, why<BR>
You cried to heaven so sadly, and for whom<BR>
You left the apples hanging on the trees;<BR>
'Twas Tityrus was away. Why, Tityrus,<BR>
The very pines, the very water-springs,<BR>
The very vineyards, cried aloud for you.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
TITYRUS<BR>
What could I do? how else from bonds be freed,<BR>
Or otherwhere find gods so nigh to aid?<BR>
There, Meliboeus, I saw that youth to whom<BR>
Yearly for twice six days my altars smoke.<BR>
There instant answer gave he to my suit,<BR>
"Feed, as before, your kine, boys, rear your bulls."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
MELIBOEUS<BR>
So in old age, you happy man, your fields<BR>
Will still be yours, and ample for your need!<BR>
Though, with bare stones o'erspread, the pastures all<BR>
Be choked with rushy mire, your ewes with young<BR>
By no strange fodder will be tried, nor hurt<BR>
Through taint contagious of a neighbouring flock.<BR>
Happy old man, who 'mid familiar streams<BR>
And hallowed springs, will court the cooling shade!<BR>
Here, as of old, your neighbour's bordering hedge,<BR>
That feasts with willow-flower the Hybla bees,<BR>
Shall oft with gentle murmur lull to sleep,<BR>
While the leaf-dresser beneath some tall rock<BR>
Uplifts his song, nor cease their cooings hoarse<BR>
The wood-pigeons that are your heart's delight,<BR>
Nor doves their moaning in the elm-tree top.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
TITYRUS<BR>
Sooner shall light stags, therefore, feed in air,<BR>
The seas their fish leave naked on the strand,<BR>
Germans and Parthians shift their natural bounds,<BR>
And these the Arar, those the Tigris drink,<BR>
Than from my heart his face and memory fade.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
MELIBOEUS<BR>
But we far hence, to burning Libya some,<BR>
Some to the Scythian steppes, or thy swift flood,<BR>
Cretan Oaxes, now must wend our way,<BR>
Or Britain, from the whole world sundered far.<BR>
Ah! shall I ever in aftertime behold<BR>
My native bounds- see many a harvest hence<BR>
With ravished eyes the lowly turf-roofed cot<BR>
Where I was king? These fallows, trimmed so fair,<BR>
Some brutal soldier will possess these fields<BR>
An alien master. Ah! to what a pass<BR>
Has civil discord brought our hapless folk!<BR>
For such as these, then, were our furrows sown!<BR>
Now, Meliboeus, graft your pears, now set<BR>
Your vines in order! Go, once happy flock,<BR>
My she-goats, go. Never again shall I,<BR>
Stretched in green cave, behold you from afar<BR>
Hang from the bushy rock; my songs are sung;<BR>
Never again will you, with me to tend,<BR>
On clover-flower, or bitter willows, browse.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
TITYRUS<BR>
Yet here, this night, you might repose with me,<BR>
On green leaves pillowed: apples ripe have I,<BR>
Soft chestnuts, and of curdled milk enow.<BR>
And, see, the farm-roof chimneys smoke afar,<BR>
And from the hills the shadows lengthening fall!<BR>
</P>

ALEXIS<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The shepherd Corydon with love was fired<BR>
For fair Alexis, his own master's joy:<BR>
No room for hope had he, yet, none the less,<BR>
The thick-leaved shadowy-soaring beech-tree grove<BR>
Still would he haunt, and there alone, as thus,<BR>
To woods and hills pour forth his artless strains.<BR>
"Cruel Alexis, heed you naught my songs?<BR>
Have you no pity? you'll drive me to my death.<BR>
Now even the cattle court the cooling shade<BR>
And the green lizard hides him in the thorn:<BR>
Now for tired mowers, with the fierce heat spent,<BR>
Pounds Thestilis her mess of savoury herbs,<BR>
Wild thyme and garlic. I, with none beside,<BR>
Save hoarse cicalas shrilling through the brake,<BR>
Still track your footprints 'neath the broiling sun.<BR>
Better have borne the petulant proud disdain<BR>
Of Amaryllis, or Menalcas wooed,<BR>
Albeit he was so dark, and you so fair!<BR>
Trust not too much to colour, beauteous boy;<BR>
White privets fall, dark hyacinths are culled.<BR>
You scorn me, Alexis, who or what I am<BR>
Care not to ask- how rich in flocks, or how<BR>
In snow-white milk abounding: yet for me<BR>
Roam on Sicilian hills a thousand lambs;<BR>
Summer or winter, still my milk-pails brim.<BR>
I sing as erst Amphion of Circe sang,<BR>
What time he went to call his cattle home<BR>
On Attic Aracynthus. Nor am I<BR>
So ill to look on: lately on the beach<BR>
I saw myself, when winds had stilled the sea,<BR>
And, if that mirror lie not, would not fear<BR>
Daphnis to challenge, though yourself were judge.<BR>
Ah! were you but content with me to dwell.<BR>
Some lowly cot in the rough fields our home,<BR>
Shoot down the stags, or with green osier-wand<BR>
Round up the straggling flock! There you with me<BR>
In silvan strains will learn to rival Pan.<BR>
Pan first with wax taught reed with reed to join;<BR>
For sheep alike and shepherd Pan hath care.<BR>
Nor with the reed's edge fear you to make rough<BR>
Your dainty lip; such arts as these to learn<BR>
What did Amyntas do?- what did he not?<BR>
A pipe have I, of hemlock-stalks compact<BR>
In lessening lengths, Damoetas' dying-gift:<BR>
'Mine once,' quoth he, 'now yours, as heir to own.'<BR>
Foolish Amyntas heard and envied me.<BR>
Ay, and two fawns, I risked my neck to find<BR>
In a steep glen, with coats white-dappled still,<BR>
From a sheep's udders suckled twice a day-<BR>
These still I keep for you; which Thestilis<BR>
Implores me oft to let her lead away;<BR>
And she shall have them, since my gifts you spurn.<BR>
Come hither, beauteous boy; for you the Nymphs<BR>
Bring baskets, see, with lilies brimmed; for you,<BR>
Plucking pale violets and poppy-heads,<BR>
Now the fair Naiad, of narcissus flower<BR>
And fragrant fennel, doth one posy twine-<BR>
With cassia then, and other scented herbs,<BR>
Blends them, and sets the tender hyacinth off<BR>
With yellow marigold. I too will pick<BR>
Quinces all silvered-o'er with hoary down,<BR>
Chestnuts, which Amaryllis wont to love,<BR>
And waxen plums withal: this fruit no less<BR>
Shall have its meed of honour; and I will pluck<BR>
You too, ye laurels, and you, ye myrtles, near,<BR>
For so your sweets ye mingle. Corydon,<BR>
You are a boor, nor heeds a whit your gifts<BR>
Alexis; no, nor would Iollas yield,<BR>
Should gifts decide the day. Alack! alack!<BR>
What misery have I brought upon my head!-<BR>
Loosed on the flowers Siroces to my bane,<BR>
And the wild boar upon my crystal springs!<BR>
Whom do you fly, infatuate? gods ere now,<BR>
And Dardan Paris, have made the woods their home.<BR>
Let Pallas keep the towers her hand hath built,<BR>
Us before all things let the woods delight.<BR>
The grim-eyed lioness pursues the wolf,<BR>
The wolf the she-goat, the she-goat herself<BR>
In wanton sport the flowering cytisus,<BR>
And Corydon Alexis, each led on<BR>
By their own longing. See, the ox comes home<BR>
With plough up-tilted, and the shadows grow<BR>
To twice their length with the departing sun,<BR>
Yet me love burns, for who can limit love?<BR>
Ah! Corydon, Corydon, what hath crazed your wit?<BR>
Your vine half-pruned hangs on the leafy elm;<BR>
Why haste you not to weave what need requires<BR>
Of pliant rush or osier? Scorned by this,<BR>
Elsewhere some new Alexis you will find."<BR>

Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung<BR>
Has come and gone, and the majestic roll<BR>
Of circling centuries begins anew:<BR>

With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.<BR>
Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom<BR>
The iron shall cease, the golden race arise,<BR>
Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own<BR>
Apollo reigns. And in thy consulate,<BR>
This glorious age, O Pollio, shall begin,<BR>
And the months enter on their mighty march.<BR>
Under thy guidance, whatso tracks remain<BR>
Of our old wickedness, once done away,<BR>
Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear.<BR>
He shall receive the life of gods, and see<BR>
Heroes with gods commingling, and himself<BR>
Be seen of them, and with his father's worth<BR>
Reign o'er a world at peace. For thee, O boy,<BR>
First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth<BR>
Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray<BR>
With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed,<BR>
And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves,<BR>
Untended, will the she-goats then bring home<BR>
Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield<BR>
Shall of the monstrous lion have no fear.<BR>
Thy very cradle shall pour forth for thee<BR>
Caressing flowers. The serpent too shall die,<BR>
Die shall the treacherous poison-plant, and far<BR>
And wide Assyrian spices spring. But soon<BR>
As thou hast skill to read of heroes' fame,<BR>
And of thy father's deeds, and inly learn<BR>
What virtue is, the plain by slow degrees<BR>
With waving corn-crops shall to golden grow,<BR>
From the wild briar shall hang the blushing grape,<BR>
And stubborn oaks sweat honey-dew. Nathless<BR>
Yet shall there lurk within of ancient wrong<BR>
Some traces, bidding tempt the deep with ships,<BR>

Therewith a second Tiphys shall there be,<BR>

New wars too shall arise, and once again<BR>
Some great Achilles to some Troy be sent.<BR>
Then, when the mellowing years have made thee man,<BR>
No more shall mariner sail, nor pine-tree bark<BR>
Ply traffic on the sea, but every land<BR>
Shall all things bear alike: the glebe no more<BR>
Shall feel the harrow's grip, nor vine the hook;<BR>
The sturdy ploughman shall loose yoke from steer,<BR>
Nor wool with varying colours learn to lie;<BR>
But in the meadows shall the ram himself,<BR>
Now with soft flush of purple, now with tint<BR>
Of yellow saffron, teach his fleece to shine.<BR>
While clothed in natural scarlet graze the lambs.<BR>
"Such still, such ages weave ye, as ye run,"<BR>
Sang to their spindles the consenting Fates<BR>
By Destiny's unalterable decree.<BR>
Assume thy greatness, for the time draws nigh,<BR>

See how it totters- the world's orbed might,<BR>
Earth, and wide ocean, and the vault profound,<BR>
All, see, enraptured of the coming time!<BR>
Ah! might such length of days to me be given,<BR>
And breath suffice me to rehearse thy deeds,<BR>
Nor Thracian Orpheus should out-sing me then,<BR>
Nor Linus, though his mother this, and that<BR>
His sire should aid- Orpheus Calliope,<BR>
And Linus fair Apollo. Nay, though Pan,<BR>
With Arcady for judge, my claim contest,<BR>

And stubborn oaks their branchy summits bow.<BR>
Not Phoebus doth the rude Parnassian crag<BR>
So ravish, nor Orpheus so entrance the heights<BR>
Of Rhodope or Ismarus: for he sang<BR>
How through the mighty void the seeds were driven<BR>
Of earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire,<BR>
How all that is from these beginnings grew,<BR>
And the young world itself took solid shape,<BR>
Then 'gan its crust to harden, and in the deep<BR>

Little by little; and how the earth amazed<BR>
Beheld the new sun shining, and the showers<BR>
Fall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods<BR>
'Gan first to rise, and living things to roam<BR>
Scattered among the hills that knew them not.<BR>
Then sang he of the stones by Pyrrha cast,<BR>
Of Saturn's reign, and of Prometheus' theft,<BR>
And the Caucasian birds, and told withal<BR>
Nigh to what fountain by his comrades left<BR>
The mariners cried on Hylas till the shore<BR>
"Then Re-echoed "Hylas, Hylas! soothed<BR>
Pasiphae with the love of her white bull-<BR>
Happy if cattle-kind had never been!-<BR>
O ill-starred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul<BR>
The daughters too of Proetus filled the fields<BR>
With their feigned lowings, yet no one of them<BR>
Of such unhallowed union e'er was fain<BR>
As with a beast to mate, though many a time<BR>
On her smooth forehead she had sought for horns,<BR>
And for her neck had feared the galling plough.<BR>
O ill-starred maid! thou roamest now the hills,<BR>
While on soft hyacinths he, his snowy side<BR>
Reposing, under some dark ilex now<BR>
Chews the pale herbage, or some heifer tracks<BR>
Amid the crowding herd. Now close, ye Nymphs,<BR>
Ye Nymphs of Dicte, close the forest-glades,<BR>
If haply there may chance upon mine eyes<BR>
The white bull's wandering foot-prints: him belike<BR>
Following the herd, or by green pasture lured,<BR>
Some kine may guide to the Gortynian stalls.<BR>
Then sings he of the maid so wonder-struck<BR>
With the apples of the Hesperids, and then<BR>
With moss-bound, bitter bark rings round the forms<BR>
Of Phaethon's fair sisters, from the ground<BR>
Up-towering into poplars. Next he sings<BR>
Of Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream,<BR>
And by a sister of the Muses led<BR>
To the Aonian mountains, and how all<BR>
The choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how<BR>
The shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine,<BR>
Brow-bound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake:<BR>
"These reeds the Muses give thee, take them thou,<BR>
Erst to the aged bard of Ascra given,<BR>
Wherewith in singing he was wont to draw<BR>
Time-rooted ash-trees from the mountain heights.<BR>
With these the birth of the Grynean grove<BR>
Be voiced by thee, that of no grove beside<BR>
Apollo more may boast him." Wherefore speak<BR>
Of Scylla, child of Nisus, who, 'tis said,<BR>
Her fair white loins with barking monsters girt<BR>
Vexed the Dulichian ships, and, in the deep<BR>
Swift-eddying whirlpool, with her sea-dogs tore<BR>
The trembling mariners? or how he told<BR>

What gifts, to him by Philomel were given;<BR>
How swift she sought the desert, with what wings<BR>

My tender myrtles, the he-goat himself,<BR>
Lord of the flock; when Daphnis I espy!<BR>
Soon as he saw me, "Hither haste," he cried,<BR>
"O Meliboeus! goat and kids are safe;<BR>
And, if you have an idle hour to spare,<BR>
Rest here beneath the shade. Hither the steers<BR>
Will through the meadows, of their own free will,<BR>
Untended come to drink. Here Mincius hath<BR>
With tender rushes rimmed his verdant banks,<BR>
And from yon sacred oak with busy hum<BR>
The bees are swarming." What was I to do?<BR>
No Phyllis or Alcippe left at home<BR>
Had I, to shelter my new-weaned lambs,<BR>
And no slight matter was a singing-bout<BR>
'Twixt Corydon and Thyrsis. Howsoe'er,<BR>
I let my business wait upon their sport.<BR>
So they began to sing, voice answering voice<BR>
In strains alternate- for alternate strains<BR>
The Muses then were minded to recall-<BR>
First Corydon, then Thyrsis in reply.<BR>

Of Damon and Alphesiboeus now,<BR>

Of Sophoclean buskin worthy found?<BR>

Heard it you had, and so the rumour ran,<BR>

Doves of Dodona when an eagle comes.<BR>
Nay, had I not, from hollow ilex-bole<BR>
Warned by a raven on the left, cut short<BR>
The rising feud, nor I, your Moeris here,<BR>

GALLUS<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
This now, the very latest of my toils,<BR>
Vouchsafe me, Arethusa! needs must I<BR>
Sing a brief song to Gallus- brief, but yet<BR>
Such as Lycoris' self may fitly read.<BR>
Who would not sing for Gallus? So, when thou<BR>
Beneath Sicanian billows glidest on,<BR>
May Doris blend no bitter wave with thine,<BR>
Begin! The love of Gallus be our theme,<BR>
And the shrewd pangs he suffered, while, hard by,<BR>
The flat-nosed she-goats browse the tender brush.<BR>
We sing not to deaf ears; no word of ours<BR>
But the woods echo it. What groves or lawns<BR>
Held you, ye Dryad-maidens, when for love-<BR>
Love all unworthy of a loss so dear-<BR>
Gallus lay dying? for neither did the slopes<BR>
Of Pindus or Parnassus stay you then,<BR>
No, nor Aonian Aganippe. Him<BR>
Even the laurels and the tamarisks wept;<BR>
For him, outstretched beneath a lonely rock,<BR>
Wept pine-clad Maenalus, and the flinty crags<BR>
Of cold Lycaeus. The sheep too stood around-<BR>
Of us they feel no shame, poet divine;<BR>
Nor of the flock be thou ashamed: even fair<BR>
Adonis by the rivers fed his sheep-<BR>
Came shepherd too, and swine-herd footing slow,<BR>
And, from the winter-acorns dripping-wet<BR>
Menalcas. All with one accord exclaim:<BR>
"From whence this love of thine?" Apollo came;<BR>
"Gallus, art mad?" he cried, "thy bosom's care<BR>
Another love is following."Therewithal<BR>
Silvanus came, with rural honours crowned;<BR>
The flowering fennels and tall lilies shook<BR>
Before him. Yea, and our own eyes beheld<BR>
Pan, god of Arcady, with blood-red juice<BR>
Of the elder-berry, and with vermilion, dyed.<BR>
"Wilt ever make an end?" quoth he, "behold<BR>
Love recks not aught of it: his heart no more<BR>
With tears is sated than with streams the grass,<BR>
Bees with the cytisus, or goats with leaves."<BR>
"Yet will ye sing, Arcadians, of my woes<BR>
Upon your mountains," sadly he replied-<BR>
"Arcadians, that alone have skill to sing.<BR>
O then how softly would my ashes rest,<BR>
If of my love, one day, your flutes should tell!<BR>
And would that I, of your own fellowship,<BR>
Or dresser of the ripening grape had been,<BR>
Or guardian of the flock! for surely then,<BR>
Let Phyllis, or Amyntas, or who else,<BR>
Bewitch me- what if swart Amyntas be?<BR>
Dark is the violet, dark the hyacinth-<BR>
Among the willows, 'neath the limber vine,<BR>
Reclining would my love have lain with me,<BR>
Phyllis plucked garlands, or Amyntas sung.<BR>
Here are cool springs, soft mead and grove, Lycoris;<BR>
Here might our lives with time have worn away.<BR>
But me mad love of the stern war-god holds<BR>
Armed amid weapons and opposing foes.<BR>
Whilst thou- Ah! might I but believe it not!-<BR>
Alone without me, and from home afar,<BR>
Look'st upon Alpine snows and frozen Rhine.<BR>
Ah! may the frost not hurt thee, may the sharp<BR>
And jagged ice not wound thy tender feet!<BR>
I will depart, re-tune the songs I framed<BR>
In verse Chalcidian to the oaten reed<BR>
Of the Sicilian swain. Resolved am I<BR>
In the woods, rather, with wild beasts to couch,<BR>
And bear my doom, and character my love<BR>
Upon the tender tree-trunks: they will grow,<BR>
And you, my love, grow with them. And meanwhile<BR>
I with the Nymphs will haunt Mount Maenalus,<BR>
Or hunt the keen wild boar. No frost so cold<BR>
But I will hem with hounds thy forest-glades,<BR>
Parthenius. Even now, methinks, I range<BR>
O'er rocks, through echoing groves, and joy to launch<BR>
Cydonian arrows from a Parthian bow.-<BR>
As if my madness could find healing thus,<BR>
Or that god soften at a mortal's grief!<BR>
Now neither Hamadryads, no, nor songs<BR>
Delight me more: ye woods, away with you!<BR>
No pangs of ours can change him; not though we<BR>
In the mid-frost should drink of Hebrus' stream,<BR>
And in wet winters face Sithonian snows,<BR>
Or, when the bark of the tall elm-tree bole<BR>
Of drought is dying, should, under Cancer's Sign,<BR>
In Aethiopian deserts drive our flocks.<BR>
Love conquers all things; yield we too to love!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
These songs, Pierian Maids, shall it suffice<BR>
Your poet to have sung, the while he sat,<BR>
And of slim mallow wove a basket fine:<BR>
To Gallus ye will magnify their worth,<BR>
Gallus, for whom my love grows hour by hour,<BR>
As the green alder shoots in early Spring.<BR>
Come, let us rise: the shade is wont to be<BR>
Baneful to singers; baneful is the shade<BR>
Cast by the juniper, crops sicken too<BR>
In shade. Now homeward, having fed your fill--<BR>
Eve's star is rising-go, my she-goats, go.<BR>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
